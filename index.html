  <h1>Confessions of a Midnight Bug Slayer</h1>

  <p>
    I like to code the same way I like my cereal — at 2 AM, in absolute silence, with a hint of panic.
    I don’t write code; I whisper sweet nothings to my compiler and pray it listens.
    When I finally fix a bug, I celebrate like I just won the Olympics, even though I’ve been wearing the same hoodie for 3 days.
    Stack Overflow is my therapist, and coffee is my blood type.
    I may not be a wizard, but have you ever seen me and a syntax error in the same room for too long? Exactly.
